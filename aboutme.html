    <h2><b><u>Petite Treats</u></b></h2>
    <p class="comments">Petite Treats has been creating awesome cakes and desserts long before it was the trendy thing to do.<br>
        We started as a family bakeshop with local community support. <br>
        Fast forward two generations and our artistry and quality continue to set the trend. <br>
        Our experience is admired though not easily replicated.<br>
        Over the years our business has grown to include a talented team of professional bakers,<br>
        decorators and customer service ambassadors.<br>
        Even still, at the heart of it all we are a family bakery dedicated to bringing you sweet memories</p>
